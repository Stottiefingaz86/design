# 🚀 How to Start the Server

## The server is not currently running. Here's how to start it:

### Step 1: Open a Terminal
Open your terminal application (Terminal.app on Mac)

### Step 2: Navigate to the project
```bash
cd /Users/christopherhunt/AIagency
```

### Step 3: Start the dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Wait for startup
You should see output like:
```
▲ Next.js 14.2.35
- Local:        http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in Xms
```

### Step 5: Open your browser
Once you see "✓ Ready", open:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

### What you'll see:
1. Logo in top-left
2. Character walking in from left (takes ~3 seconds)
3. Character stops at center
4. Chat appears below character
5. Intro content in right sidebar after ~3.5 seconds

## ✅ All Issues Fixed:
- Build now passes ✅
- Character animation fixed ✅
- TypeScript errors resolved ✅
- Visual markups ready ✅

## 💡 Tip:
Keep the terminal window open - that's where the server is running. You'll see logs there.
If you close it, the server stops. Just run `npm run dev` again to restart.
