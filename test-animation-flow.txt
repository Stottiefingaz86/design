ANIMATION FLOW SHOULD BE:
1. Start: animationState = 'walking', hasArrived = false
2. Walk-in: Framer Motion animates x from -100vw to 0 (3 seconds)
3. After 3s: hasArrived = true (via timer or onComplete)
4. Transition: animationState changes from 'walking' to 'idle'
5. Idle loop: currentFrame cycles 0-5 (shows images 5-10)

KOOL SHOULD ONLY TRIGGER:
- When triggerKoolAnimation = true (from chat)
- AND hasArrived = true
- AND animationState = 'idle'
